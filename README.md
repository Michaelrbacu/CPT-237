# CPT-237
My CPT 237 Project - This was a group project for my Advanced Java Programming class where the objective was to build a functional game using JavaFX

For the project my team and I built a version of the sorry board game online. You will need to use JavaFX in order to run it properly.

- The project included a music file but its too large for github but you can add music by downloading whatever you'd like and naming it "music.mp3".
